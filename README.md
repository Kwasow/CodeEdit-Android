# CodeEdit (Android)

![Android build](https://github.com/Kwasow/CodeEdit-Android/workflows/Android%20CI/badge.svg)

This project aims to create a code editor app for Android, that's based on a server implementation. The code would be stored on a self-hosted server and accesed through ssh and other networking tools via the app.

This allows to build and deploy projects directly from your Android phone and gives you the power of a full OS on the go.

The app might get more useful when Android's desktop mode is made available to everyone by Google in some version of Android in the future.
